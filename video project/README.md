# Project Description: An Immersive Interactive Video Experience on Personal Growth

Our project revolved around the concept of creating an immersive video that has an element of interactivity that delves into the themes of personal growth. We focused on the concept of stepping outside one's comfort zone to achieve personal goals, as it resonated with our own experiences as students in our twenties. We wanted the main character to be someone we can all relate to. We have all been through the stresses of university and having it sometimes take over our whole life without thinking of how to balance it. In our video, we wanted to give the reader a choice, to show that a work-life balance is truly vital and you can thrive in both aspects of your life. As they navigate through the website, users make choices that impact the story's outcome, ultimately shaping Tarek's journey of self-discovery and personal growth.

## Process: Detailed Implementation and Overcoming Challenges

### Pre-Production and Storyboarding

Before diving into the filming process, our team spent considerable time brainstorming ideas and developing a compelling storyline. We carefully crafted the different scenarios and decision points that would make the user feel involved in Tarek's journey. The storyboarding phase was essential in creating a visual blueprint for our interactive video experience and ensuring that all team members were aligned in terms of narrative and visual style.

### Filming and Production

The filming process required dedication and attention to detail, as we were determined to create a visually appealing experience. We used professional equipment to ensure high-quality footage, and despite being relatively new to cinematography, we were eager to learn and overcome the challenges that came our way. This stage was time-consuming and demanding, as we had to coordinate schedules, scout locations, rehearse scenes, and experiment with camera angles to make the most out of our resources. Learning the hardware took time, but since we had a session, we had some background information and were just building on it.

### Video Editing and Post-Production

After completing the filming process, we moved on to editing the footage using Adobe Premiere Pro. This stage was probably the steepest learning curve for us, as we had to familiarize ourselves with the software and its capabilities. We spent countless hours watching tutorials, experimenting with different tools, and refining the final cut to create a seamless and emotionally impactful video. The challenge was to effectively merge the different storylines, create smooth transitions, and maintain consistent pacing and tone throughout the video.

### Video Perspectives: Creating Immersion with Different POVs

In addition to the choppy audio design, we intended for the videos to be shot from different perspectives to further immerse users in Tarek's journey. By capturing various points of view, we aimed to provide a diverse and engaging visual experience, allowing users to feel more connected to the story. However, we made a mistake in not blurring the background in some shots, which may have detracted from the intended effect of the different perspectives. In future projects, we plan to pay closer attention to details like background blur and depth of field to enhance the immersive quality of our interactive video experiences and ensure a more cohesive visual narrative.

### Audio Design: Intentionally Choppy, Yet Room for Improvement

We intentionally designed the audio to be choppy in some parts of the video, as we wanted to create a sense of different perspectives and immerse the user in various points of view. This artistic choice was meant to add depth to the story and help users feel more connected to Tarek's journey. However, we acknowledge that our audio editing skills were limited, and we made a mistake in equalizing the audio. In hindsight, we wish we had more expertise to fully rectify this issue and create a more polished audio experience for our users. In future projects, we aim to further develop our audio editing skills to ensure a higher quality and more immersive soundscape for our interactive video experiences.

### Website Development and Customization

To host our interactive video, we chose a website template from NicePages as a foundation. However, we wanted to create a distinctive and engaging platform, so we incorporated various custom elements to the template. With our baseline coding skills, we managed to implement interactive features that allowed users to choose different scenarios and navigate through the story. The website development process, though challenging, was a rewarding experience that allowed us to expand our skill set.

### Nicepages
Although NicePages provided us with a solid foundation and many helpful tools for our website, we still faced some challenges during the development process. One of the main difficulties we encountered was the inability to edit the NicePages CSS directly, which limited our customization options. Additionally, we had to carefully remove redundant parts of the code to optimize the website's performance. Despite these obstacles, our team managed to add numerous custom elements and interactive features, using our creativity and problem-solving skills to bring our vision to life. The platform's ease of use and variety of templates were helpful, but we still had to invest a significant amount of time and effort to create the unique and engaging website we envisioned for our interactive video experience.

### Cinematography Techniques: Capturing the Story
To produce a professional-quality video, our team carefully considered various cinematography techniques that we had learned from our session with Terry. We decided not to have Tarek break the fourth wall, maintaining a sense of immersion for the viewers. By utilizing different camera angles, close-ups, and wide shots, we were able to create a visual narrative that complemented the story's themes and emotions. We made full use of the camera and tripod features to create dynamic shots, experimenting with camera movement, focus, and depth of field to add depth and dimension to each scene.
Furthermore, we intentionally designed some scenes to be repetitive, emphasizing the monotonous routine of Tarek's daily life, while other scenes were crafted to be more vibrant and engaging to showcase the exciting changes he experiences as he embarks on his journey of self-discovery. This juxtaposition of repetitive and dynamic sequences helped to accentuate the contrast between Tarek's old life and his newfound pursuit of personal growth.

### Location Scouting: Filming with Minimal Disturbance
Finding suitable locations for filming was a challenge, as we wanted to minimize disruptions to others and avoid any issues with obtaining consent. We had to coordinate with various facilities, such as the rock-climbing wall, to gain special permission to film during off-peak hours. This required us to arrive early in the morning, ensuring that we did not interfere with ongoing classes or someone's personal time at the facility. Despite the logistical challenges and the need for careful planning, we managed to secure the necessary locations and film our scenes without causing any inconvenience to others.
To further minimize disturbance, we took extra precautions when filming in public spaces. We utilized compact equipment, employed efficient shooting techniques, and carefully planned our shots to minimize setup time and reduce the impact on bystanders. This meticulous approach to location scouting and filming allowed us to capture authentic environments while respecting the privacy and comfort of those around us.

### User Interface Design: Simple, Basic, and Functional
In designing the user interface for our website, we aimed to keep it simple, basic, and functional, with the primary focus being on the video of the project. We wanted to ensure that users could easily navigate the website and interact with the video without any distractions. By concentrating on creating a clean and intuitive interface, we were able to direct users' attention towards the engaging and thought-provoking content of the video, while still providing a seamless and enjoyable browsing experience.
To achieve this, we carefully selected a color palette and typography that complemented the video's visual style and created a cohesive aesthetic throughout the website. We also designed custom icons and graphics to enhance the user interface and make it more visually appealing. Despite our limited coding experience, we managed to implement a responsive design that adapted to various screen sizes and devices, ensuring that all users could access and interact with the website comfortably.
By striking a balance between simplicity and functionality, our team was able to develop a user interface that successfully showcased our interactive video experience while providing a smooth and enjoyable browsing experience for users.

### Reflection and Future Improvements
Reflecting on our journey, we take pride in the final product and feel that we have successfully conveyed the message of personal growth and stepping outside one's comfort zone. The interactive video experience we created offers a unique and engaging way for users to connect with the story and make choices that impact the outcome.
There is always room for growth and improvement which is why in the future, we would like to explore more diverse storylines. This would give users an even wider array of options to choose from, and create a more responsive and mobile-friendly website to enhance the user experience. Additionally, we could refine our editing skills further to create smoother transitions between different scenarios, improve the overall video quality, and perhaps experiment with visual effects to enrich the storytelling.
We would also consider conducting user testing to gather feedback on the interactive experience, which could provide valuable insights for optimizing the user interface and making the story more engaging.
Although the project got tough at times, especially given that it is nearing the end of the semester, it has been incredibly rewarding seeing everything come to fruition. We pushed ourselves creatively and as the motto of our project said we pushed ourselves out of our comfort zone!
