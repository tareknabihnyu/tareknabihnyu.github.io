I designed this website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I started by creating the basic structure of the website, including the head and body sections, and then I added meta tags for search engine optimization and Google Analytics tracking.

I also included the Google Tag Manager script to manage website tags and the Font Awesome library to use icons. For the styling, I used several CSS files for different sections, such as the color scheme and the animation effects.

The navigation bar includes links to different parts of the website, and the user can download my CV from a link in the header. Additionally, I added social media icons for users to access my profiles.

My goal was to create a professional-looking website that highlights my skills and experiences. I paid attention to the design, layout, and functionality to ensure a positive user experience.
