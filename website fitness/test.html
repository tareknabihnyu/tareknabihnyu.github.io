  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT GYM</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>Why do I love gym?</em></p>
  <p>There are many reasons why someone should love going to the gym. Regular exercise is essential for maintaining good physical health, as it can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases, improve cardiovascular health,
     increase muscle strength and flexibility, and improve overall fitness. Additionally, working out at the gym can boost your mental health and reduce stress levels. Exercise has been shown to boost mood, increase self-confidence,
      and improve sleep quality. The gym is also a great place to socialize and meet new people who share similar interests, as well as a supportive and encouraging community. Whether you're trying to lose weight, gain muscle, 
      or simply stay active, the gym provides the equipment, resources, and atmosphere to help you achieve your goals and lead a healthier, happier life..</p>

      <img src="w3images/avatar_hat.png" class="w3-round w3-image w3-opacity w3-hover-opacity-off" alt="Photo of Me" width="500" height="333" style="margin-top: 20px;

    <div class="w3-col m6 w3-hide-small w3-padding-large">
      <!-- /* w3-hide-small makes the div or the container invinisable */ -->
      <p>As a college student at NYUAD from Egypt, I never thought I would become a gym enthusiast. I used to be skinny and lacked confidence in my physical appearance. But that all changed when I discovered the power of the gym.

        Going to the gym was a game-changer for me. I was able to sculpt my body, build muscle, and increase my overall strength and fitness. The transformation I experienced was not just physical, but also mental. 
        The gym gave me a sense of empowerment and self-esteem that I never knew I was capable of having. I felt proud of what I was able to accomplish and it motivated me to work even harder.
        
        The gym is not just a place to work out, it's a community. I met amazing people, including trainers and fellow gym-goers who were always there to support and encourage me. They helped me push through tough workouts and reach my goals.
        
        In conclusion, the gym has been a life-changing experience for me. I'm grateful for the transformation it has brought about in my life and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their physical and mental well-being.
         Whether you're a seasoned fitness enthusiast or a beginner, the gym has something to offer for everyone..</p>
